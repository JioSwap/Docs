## HIGHLIGHTS

## Multi-chain

Jioswap supports multiple EVM blockchain networks. Bad user experience is one of the most critical issues in accelerating adoption of DeFi for the everyday person. High gas fees on Ethereum is obviously the most highlighted. however although Binance solves that issue it also has its cons. Jioswap aims to mitigate this by supporting numerous chains, ie: Fantom, Optimism Layer 2 etc.. each solving a particular issue for the end user. Giving the end user options that best suit  their needs for a specific transaction.

## Bridges

Jioswap bridges aims to support most EVM compatible chains that meets the volume requirements. However we are more focused on bridging layer1 & layer2 "Non-EVM" chains, enabling users who hold assets on those chains to bring their assets over, transact / interact with Defi applications and more.

**Good to know:** Bridges are permissionless applications that allow users to send tokens and arbitrary data between blockchain networks.

## Why is Jio Important?

If a DeFi user is looking to swap $100,000 USDC to fUSDT. Using the traditional AMM such as uniswap, pancakeswap, spooky swap etc..  you'd receive roughly $98690 fUSDT - losing $1310 in value. If you were to use Jioswap instead, you'd receive $99,652.234704 - almost zero slippage. Jioswap protocol is specifically designed for pegged assets, and as a result, it is much more efficient than an AMM such as Panacakeswap that is not optimized to do so.
